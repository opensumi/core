## Quickstart

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run init
$ npm run start
```

By default, the `tools/workspace` folder in the project would be opened, or you can run the project by specifying the directory in the following way:

```bash
$ MY_WORKSPACE={local_path} npm run start
```

Usually, you may still encounter some system-level environment dependencies. You can visit [Development Environment Preparation](./CONTRIBUTING-zh_CN.md#Development Environment Preparation) to see how to install the corresponding environment dependencies.
