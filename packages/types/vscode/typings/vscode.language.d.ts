      * Compute the match between a document [selector](#DocumentSelector) and a document. Values
      * greater than zero mean the selector matches the document.
      *
      * A match is computed according to these rules:
      * 1. When [`DocumentSelector`](#DocumentSelector) is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
      * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
      * 3. A [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter) will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
      *  1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
      *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesnâ€™t match, the result is `0`
      *  3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
      *  4. The result is the maximum value of each match
      *
      * Samples:
      * ```js
      * // default document from disk (file-scheme)
      * doc.uri; //'file:///my/file.js'
      * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
      * match('javascript', doc); // 10;
      * match({language: 'javascript'}, doc); // 10;
      * match({language: 'javascript', scheme: 'file'}, doc); // 10;
      * match('*', doc); // 5
      * match('fooLang', doc); // 0
      * match(['fooLang', '*'], doc); // 5
      *
      * // virtual document, e.g. from git-index
      * doc.uri; // 'git:/my/file.js'
      * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
      * match('javascript', doc); // 10;
      * match({language: 'javascript', scheme: 'git'}, doc); // 10;
      * match('*', doc); // 5
