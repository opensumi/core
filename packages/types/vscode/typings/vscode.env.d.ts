     * #### `http:` or `https:` scheme
     *
     * Resolves an *external* uri, such as a `http:` or `https:` link, from where the extension is running to a
     * uri to the same resource on the client machine.
     *
     * This is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine.
     *
     * If the extension is running remotely, this function automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel
     * from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel. The lifetime of
     * the port fowarding tunnel is managed by VS Code and the tunnel can be closed by the user.
     *
     * *Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
     *
     * #### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
     *
     * Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered [UriHandler](#UriHandler)
     * to trigger.
     *
     * Extensions should not make any assumptions about the resulting uri and should not alter it in anyway.
     * Rather, extensions can e.g. use this uri in an authentication flow, by adding the uri as callback query
     * argument to the server to authenticate to.
     *
     * *Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
     * will appear in the uri that is passed to the [UriHandler](#UriHandler).
     *
     * **Example** of an authentication flow:
     * ```typescript
     * vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
     *   handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {
     *     if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {
     *       console.log(uri.toString());
     *     }
     *   }
     * });
     *
     * const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(`${vscode.env.uriScheme}://my.extension/did-authenticate`));
     * await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
     * ```
     *
     * *Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
     * a system or user action — for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
     * `asExternalUri`.
     *
     * @return A uri that can be used on the client machine.
